## Coding Standards 

- **TyperScript** use typescript wherever is required. Example when creating varibles, passing parameters, defining funtions etc.

- **Props and State**: Always destructure props and avoid passing unnecessary props to components.
  - Use default props to avoid undefined values and ensure type safety (TypeScript or PropTypes).

- **Component Modularity**: All components are managed within the `src/components` directory
  - Components Should be 'Client Component'
  - Keep components small and reusable.
  - Each component should have a single responsibility and be easily testable.
